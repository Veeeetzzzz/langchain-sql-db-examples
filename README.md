# Langchain SQL database examples

Examples of how to use Langchain's SQL DB agents + chains - use these to interact with your database (mySQL, PostgreSQL) using natural language.

# Usage

These will all be in Python - so download the script you want to use, navigate to the directory it's stored in via CMD/PowerShell/Terminal and run the file

e.g. `python connect.py`

# PostgreSQL

This Python script connects to a PostgreSQL database and imports a specified table. Error messages will confirm once you connect to database and how many rows it was able to select from the table.
